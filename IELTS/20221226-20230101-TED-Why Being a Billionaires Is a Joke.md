And then I said, "Thank you". **The** true story, and then we **made out in snow**. I apologize everything **than** I do, I apologize **at** first time **the** girl told she **love** me, **it was** just like "sorry". **It was** really funny. **There was** in Canadian city called surrey, S, U, R, R, E, Y. It's right next. **Surrey**, **It's feel** with Indian and south **Asia** people.

My name is Pardis Parker, I live in Los Angeles, but I'm from Canada. 

我叫Pardis Parker，我住在洛杉矶，但是我来自加拿大。

If you guys want evidence that I'm Canadian this is a true story. 

如果你们想要证据证明我是加拿大人，这是一个真实的故事。

I once had someone ride over my foot with with their bicycle and I said sorry. And then I said, "Thank you". **It's a** true story. 

有一次，有个人骑着他的自行车压了我的脚，但是我却向他道歉了，然后又说了一句谢谢。这是个真实的故事。

And then we **both did shots of maple syrup**. 

然后我们两个人都喝了枫糖浆。

Really, and then we made out in the snow, It's quite, it was lovely. 

真的，然后我们在雪地里亲热起来，真的很可爱。

I apologize everything **man** I do, I apologize **the** first time **a** girl told she **loved** me. **I was** just like "sorry". 

我为我所作的一切事情道歉，朋友，当一个女孩第一次告诉我她爱我时，我说了，对不起

**Here's what's** really funny, there's a Canadian city called Surrey, s-u-r-r-e-y. It's right next to us Surrey is filled with Indian and south Asian people.

真正有趣的是，加拿大有一个城市叫做萨里，s-u-r-r-e-y，它就在我们旁边，萨里到处都是印度和那南亚人。

> So it's has a bunch of Indian South Asian shops, stores, boutiques, the whole bit, which means at least once in history, the following **thing** has played out. "Hey, **what did** you get your sorry?". "Sorry". "Sorry?". If you don't like that joke, sorry. And also Thank you. So I from Canada but I live in Los Angeles, I think the biggest difference between Canada and LA is the extent to which people in LA fetishize wealth, like it's to the point where I'm shocked that there isn't a wealth category for adult videos. But then I **though** about it, and I **realize** those **wealth** fetish videos do exist it's just **there** are not **what** you think **it's maybe**, **there** are not at **all bunsid**, no. They are on **argitecture.com**. People just touring, **they are mad at states** **where we see it** at home watching on **their** laptops in the dark, going "show me, show me at the way to be", but don't, because ..., I'm terrified, man. I'm terrified that the LA is changing me. **They are** becoming one of those people who **trace** **is** money, who **fetish is well**, who wants to be a billionaire. **I see the** people get angry, they get **...**, it's like "What's wrong with being rich? What's wrong with being a billionaire? What's wrong with being **...**,". It's just like "Yo, man, If you own a billion of anything, that's **will** makes you **sawi**, that makes you a ...".

So it's has a bunch of Indian South Asian shops, stores, boutiques, the whole bit, which means at least once in history the following **scene** has played out. 

所以萨里有一堆印度南亚商店、精品店、整个街区都是。这意味着历史上至少有一次以下场景已经玩完了。

"Hey, **where'd** you get your sorry?". "Sorry". "Sorry?". 

嘿，你是从哪里得到你的道歉的，对不起？对不起。

If you don't like that joke, sorry. And also Thank you. 

如果你们不喜欢这个笑话，那么对不起，然后，谢谢。

So I from Canada but I live in Los Angeles, I think the biggest difference between Canada and LA is the extent to which people in LA fetishize wealth like it's to the point where I'm shocked that there isn't a wealth category for adult videos. 

我来自加拿大，但是住在洛杉矶，我认为加拿大和洛杉矶最大的区别是延伸洛杉矶迷恋财富，以至于我对成人视频没有财富类别感到震惊

But then I **thought** about it, and I **realize** those **well-fetished** videos do exist it's just **they** are not **what** you think **they'd**, they are not on adult websites, no. 

但后来我想了想，我意识到那些迷恋的视频确实存在，他们不是不是你认为的那样，他们不是成人网站。不是。

They are on **architecturaldigest.com**. 

他们在architecturaldigest.com这个网站。

People just touring, **their massive Estates** **while we sit** at home watching on **our** laptops in the dark going "show me, show me a closet that's way too big, show me a closet so big you cloud house refugees in it", 

人们只是参观他们巨大的庄园，而我们坐在家里在黑暗中，看我们的笔记本，给我看看，给我看一个很大的壁橱。给我看一个大到你可以在里面按照难民的壁橱

but don't, because **then where would you keep your cufflinks**. 

但不要，因为那你会把袖扣放在哪里

I'm terrified, man. I'm terrified that the LA is changing me **that I'm** becoming one of those people who **chases** money, who **fetishizes wealth**, who wants to be a billionaire. 

我很害怕，朋友，我很害怕，洛杉矶正在改变我，我正在变成那些追逐钱、追逐财富的人中的一员

**When I say that **people get angry, they get defensive. It's like "What's wrong with being rich?", "What's wrong with being a billionaire?", "What's wrong with being financially Savvy". It's just like, "Yo, man, If you own a billion of anything **that** **doesn't** make you **Savvy** that makes you a hoarder".
