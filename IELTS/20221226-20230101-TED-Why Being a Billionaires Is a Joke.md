And then I said, "Thank you". **The** true story, and then we **made out in snow**. I apologize everything **than** I do, I apologize **at** first time **the** girl told she **love** me, **it was** just like "sorry". **It was** really funny. **There was** in Canadian city called surrey, S, U, R, R, E, Y. It's right next. **Surrey**, **It's feel** with Indian and south **Asia** people.

My name is Pardis Parker, I live in Los Angeles, but I'm from Canada. 

我叫Pardis Parker，我住在洛杉矶，但是我来自加拿大。

If you guys want evidence that I'm Canadian this is a true story. 

如果你们想要证据证明我是加拿大人，这是一个真实的故事。

I once had someone ride over my foot with with their bicycle and I said sorry. And then I said, "Thank you". **It's a** true story. 

有一次，有个人骑着他的自行车压了我的脚，但是我却向他道歉了，然后又说了一句谢谢。这是个真实的故事。

And then we **both did shots of maple syrup**. 

然后我们两个人都喝了枫糖浆。

Really, and then we made out in the snow, It's quite, it was lovely. 

真的，然后我们在雪地里亲热起来，真的很可爱。

I apologize everything **man** I do, I apologize **the** first time **a** girl told she **loved** me. **I was** just like "sorry". 

我为我所作的一切事情道歉，朋友，当一个女孩第一次告诉我她爱我时，我说了，对不起

**Here's what's** really funny, there's a Canadian city called Surrey, s-u-r-r-e-y. It's right next to us Surrey is filled with Indian and south Asian people.

真正有趣的是，加拿大有一个城市叫做萨里，s-u-r-r-e-y，它就在我们旁边，萨里到处都是印度和那南亚人。

> So it's has a bunch of Indian South Asian shops, stores, boutiques, the whole bit, which means at least once in history, the following **thing** has played out. "Hey, **what did** you get your sorry?". "Sorry". "Sorry?". If you don't like that joke, sorry. And also Thank you. So I from Canada but I live in Los Angeles, I think the biggest difference between Canada and LA is the extent to which people in LA fetishize wealth, like it's to the point where I'm shocked that there isn't a wealth category for adult videos. But then I **though** about it, and I **realize** those **wealth** fetish videos do exist it's just **there** are not **what** you think **it's maybe**, **there** are not at **all bunsid**, no. They are on **argitecture.com**. People just touring, **they are mad at states** **where we see it** at home watching on **their** laptops in the dark, going "show me, show me at the way to be", but don't, because ..., I'm terrified, man. I'm terrified that the LA is changing me. **They are** becoming one of those people who **trace** **is** money, who **fetish is well**, who wants to be a billionaire. **I see the** people get angry, they get **...**, it's like "What's wrong with being rich? What's wrong with being a billionaire? What's wrong with being **...**,". It's just like "Yo, man, If you own a billion of anything, that's **will** makes you **sawi**, that makes you a ...".

So it's has a bunch of Indian South Asian shops, stores, boutiques, the whole bit, which means at least once in history the following **scene** has played out. 

所以萨里有一堆印度南亚商店、精品店、整个街区都是。这意味着历史上至少有一次以下场景已经玩完了。

"Hey, **where'd** you get your sorry?". "Sorry". "Sorry?". 

嘿，你是从哪里得到你的道歉的，对不起？对不起。

If you don't like that joke, sorry. And also Thank you. 

如果你们不喜欢这个笑话，那么对不起，然后，谢谢。

So I from Canada but I live in Los Angeles, I think the biggest difference between Canada and LA is the extent to which people in LA fetishize wealth like it's to the point where I'm shocked that there isn't a wealth category for adult videos. 

我来自加拿大，但是住在洛杉矶，我认为加拿大和洛杉矶最大的区别是延伸洛杉矶迷恋财富，以至于我对成人视频没有财富类别感到震惊

But then I **thought** about it, and I **realize** those **well-fetished** videos do exist it's just **they** are not **what** you think **they'd**, they are not on adult websites, no. 

但后来我想了想，我意识到那些迷恋的视频确实存在，他们不是不是你认为的那样，他们不是成人网站。不是。

They are on **architecturaldigest.com**. 

他们在architecturaldigest.com这个网站。

People just touring, **their massive Estates** **while we sit** at home watching on **our** laptops in the dark going "show me, show me a closet that's way too big, show me a closet so big you cloud house refugees in it", 

人们只是参观他们巨大的庄园，而我们坐在家里在黑暗中，看我们的笔记本，给我看看，给我看一个很大的壁橱。给我看一个大到你可以在里面按照难民的壁橱

but don't, because **then where would you keep your cufflinks**. 

但不要，因为那你会把袖扣放在哪里

I'm terrified, man. I'm terrified that the LA is changing me **that I'm** becoming one of those people who **chases** money, who **fetishizes wealth**, who wants to be a billionaire. 

我很害怕，朋友，我很害怕，洛杉矶正在改变我，我正在变成那些追逐钱、追逐财富的人中的一员

**When I say that **people get angry, they get defensive. 

当我这么说的时候，人们会变得生气，他们会变得具有防御性

It's like "What's wrong with being rich?", "What's wrong with being a billionaire?", "What's wrong with being financially Savvy". 

这就像是富有有什么错？称为亿万富翁有什么错？成为精通财务的人有什么错？

It's just like, "Yo, man, If you own a billion of anything **that** **doesn't** make you **Savvy** that makes you a hoarder".

就像，哟，朋友，如果你拥有十亿的钱，这不会让你变得精明，但是会让你变成一个囤积者。

**Like there's no episode of orders where they go into someone's house and see a billion pieces unopened mail that are just like man,** this guy is savvy.

就像没有订单的情节，他们进入某人的房子并且看到十亿件未打开的邮件，就像男人一样的这家伙的精明。

**What a shrewd collector of unopened man he is**, I hope **he** **writes** a book. 

多么精明的收藏家，未开封的男性，我希望他写一本书。

People get angry man, they get defensive, **They're just like oh there's valid reasons to be rich, there's valid reasons to be rich**, I just want to be **rich to build **generational wealth, that's it. 

人们生气，他们变得防御，他们就像，哦，有正当的理由变得富有，我只是想变得富有，来建立世代财富，就是这样。

I just want to be **build **generational wealth and just like, "Yo, man, Why would you do that to your kids like no one's favorite **kid** at school was **Bentley Worthington III**". 

我只是想建立世代财富，这就像，哟，朋友，你为什么要对你的孩子那样做，就像学校里没有人最喜欢的孩子是宾利沃辛顿三世一样。

Like no one has **fun** memories of **Clan** money nuts junior of the famous money nuts **Clan** who made their fortune in shipping. 

就像没有人对小钱坚果族有着有趣的回忆，他们是在航运业发家致富的。

No one needs it, man. No one needs it. People get angry. 

没有人需要它，朋友，没有人需要它，人们会生气

They are like, oh, this is there's personal reasons to want to be rich, like the only reason why I want to be rich is to cement my legacy, that's it, I just want to cement my legacy. 

他们就像，想要致富的是他的个人原因，就像我想要致富的唯一原因是想要巩固我的遗产，就是这么简单，我只是想要巩固我的遗产

**And sounds like**, "Yo, man, being rich **isn't** gonna make history remember you, you know how I know, there's 2668 billionaires on the planet  right now.". Name them. 

听起来就像，哟，朋友，变得富有不会让历史记住你，你知道我怎么知道的吗，地球上有2668位亿万富翁，你能叫的出他们的名字吗

You can't. And that's **why** they're still alive. I mean **hell** there is 12 billionaires in this room right now we don't know who they are. 

你不知道他们叫什么名字，这就是他们为什么还活着的原因，我的意思是，我们这个房间现有就有12位亿万富翁，但是我们并不知道他们是谁

**They're sitting next to us picking their nose**, and we are just like, "Man, I hope **things** work out **for** this guy". 

他们也许坐在我们旁边挖鼻子，我们希望这个人能一切顺利

Being rich, being a billionaires that **not going to** make a people remember you. 

变得富有，变成亿万富翁，不会让人们记住你

Man, for some reason, we all have this fantasy **at some point in the future** we are all going to be **huddled** around a **campfire**, and someone's gonna go, you  know whose life I really **admired**, that of xxx. 

出于某种原因，我们都有这种幻想，在未来的某个时刻，我们都会挤在篝火旁，然后有人会离开，你知道我真正钦佩谁的生活吗，

Oh, sure the world is ending and Humanity's doomed. 

哦，确定世界末日和人类注定好

Well you know who lived their life right way. Taiwanese petrochemical Zion long shin. 

你知道谁用着正确的生活过着他们的生活吗？台湾石化

Oh who me? Oh, I'm just the farmer, **works the soil loves his family**, I'll be forgotten, you know who history will never forget? **Italian air conditioning Mogul** just to be DeLonghi. 

哦，我是谁，我只是一个农名，在家种田，爱着他的家人，我会被这个世界遗忘，你知道历史不会遗忘谁吗。意大利空调大亨，只是为了成位德龙

Being a billionaires, man, it's **going to** make history remember you, it‘s not going to **leave you a legacy**. 

成为亿万富翁不会让历史记住你，它不会给你留下遗产

You want to leave a **legacy**, there's only one thing you need to do, you want to leave a legacy, **you just need to be the one house on the street** that gives out full-size chocolate bars for Halloween. 

你想要留下遗产？你只需要做一件事就行，你需要称为街上唯一一家位万圣节提供全尺寸巧克力棒的房子

That's it. That's it. **Legacy cemented it's been 30 years since I went trick-or-treating and me and my brother still talk about 39 Brennan Drive.** 

就是这么简单，遗产巩固，我去玩不给糖就捣蛋已经 30 年了，我和我的兄弟还在谈论 39 Brennan Drive

We're just like oh Sam and Lucy, oh those people were Saints, they were angels, someone should build a statue in their honor to celebrate their legacy as they enriched people in the audience who were offended by those jokes. 

我们就像，哦，山姆和露西，哦，那些人是圣徒，他们是天使，有人应该为他们建造一座雕像来庆祝他们的遗产，因为他们丰富了观众中那些被那些笑话冒犯的人

I only have one word for you, sorry. **And also thank you. Now let's go make out in the snow.** My name is Pardis Parker, thank you for coming to my second TED talk.

我只有一个词送给你，抱歉，也谢谢你，现在让我们在雪地里亲热把，我叫Pardis Parker，感谢大家第二次参加我的TED演讲。
