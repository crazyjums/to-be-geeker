My name is Pardis Parker, I live in Los Angeles, but I'm from Canada. If you guys want evidence that I'm Canadian this is a true story. I once had someone ride over my foot with with their bicycle and I said sorry. And then I said, "Thank you". **It's a** true story. And then we **both did shots of maple syrup**. Really, and then we made out in the snow, It's quite, it was lovely. I apologize everything **man** I do, I apologize **the** first time **a** girl told she **loved** me. **I was** just like "sorry". **Here's what's** really funny, there's a Canadian city called Surrey, s-u-r-r-e-y. It's right next to us Suri is filled with Indian and south Asian people.
