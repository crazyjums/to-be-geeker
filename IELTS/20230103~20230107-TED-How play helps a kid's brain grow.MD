> Fifteen years ago, I **walked a** classroom as a first year pre-school teacher. **Anbisious**, and **eago** to **empress**, I created this **saled arguement**, to **tracked** the things I thought most mattered for **most** students. Letters, Numbers, Shapes, and Colors. Looking back **thought** with What I know now, I wish I **went to a brother with excel a rong memberziion**, **I wishing instead of I have labriage power of bring building in the active play**. For years, we have known that **previous** learning is far **spril for to row memorition**. Harvard **son-arround** developing tells us, as **more** as institutions that play and specially and back and force eracltions. The serve and **be** return, the **autonity**, **comment**, questions, **structures** between children and adults when they play together, **that** what helps build **narrow** connections in the child's brain. And **Inparticer**, they build brains pre..., that's exactive control son of the brain, the **part of** that manages of emotions, **soft** problems, **make** **the** plans, all things that children have to do when they play. **So we think of that way**, play is actually hard work. If learning is like a work out **of** the brain, then **previous learning** is heavy lifting. And just **having lifting build mousle**, **previous learning** build the brain's architecture. So then where do us asking grow-ups coming,

Fifteen years ago, I **walked into a** classroom as a first-year preschool teacher. 

15年前，我作为一年级学前班老师走进教室。

**Ambitious**, and **eager** to **impress**, I created this **excel document **to **track** the things I thought most mattered for **my** students. Letters, Numbers, Shapes, and Colors. 

雄心勃勃且渴望给人留下深刻印象，我创建了这个excel文档，来跟踪我认为对我的学生最重要的事情：字母、数字、形状、和颜色。

Looking back **though** with What I know now, I wish I **wouldn't have bothered with excel or rote memorization, I wish instead I had leveraged the power of brain-building interactive play**. 

不过，回顾过去，以我现在所知道的，我希望我不会为excel或死记硬背而烦恼，相反，我希望我已经利用了大脑互动游戏的力量。

For years, we have known that **play-based** learning is far **superior to rote memorization**. 

多年来，我们都知道，知道基于游戏的学习远优于死记硬背。

Harvard's **Center on the** Developing  **Child** tells us, as **well** as **countless other** institutions, that play, and especially the back and forth interactions. The serve and return, the **alternating** **comments**, questions, **gestures** between children and adults when they play together, **that's** what helps build **neural** connections in the child's brain.

哈佛儿童发展中心告诉我们，以及无数其他机构，玩耍，尤其是来回互动，发球、回球、儿童和成人一起玩耍时的交替评论、问题和手势，就是这样，有助于在孩子的大脑中建立神经连接。

And **in particular**, **they build the brain's prefrontal cortex**. 

特别是，他们构建了大脑的前额叶皮层。

That's the **executive** control **center** of the brain. **the part that** manages emotions, **solves** problems, **makes** plans--all things that children have to do when they play. 

那是大脑的执行控制中心，管理情绪、解决问题、制定计划的部分---孩子们在玩耍时必须做的所有事情。

**So when we think of it that way**, play is actually hard work. 

因此，当我们这样想时，玩耍其实实际上是一项艰苦的工作。

If learning is like a **workout** **for** the brain, then **play-based learning** is heavy lifting. And just **as heavy lifting builds muscle**, **play-based learning** build the brain's architecture. **So then where do us as grown-ups come in?**

如果学习就像锻炼大脑，那么基于游戏的学习就是繁重的工作，就像举重可以锻炼肌肉一样，基于游戏的学习可以构建大脑的结构，那么我们成年人从哪里来的呢？

So it's the play **pared** with the adults' interactions, it's like super food for the brain.

But **there is** far away from reality, we don't see **why** **spbread** up take **a way** among parents and teachers, and sometimes we even see **reexistance**. So what's going on? What's driving us as parents and teachers to ignore the overwhelming research when **they** comes to play. After years of teaching preschool, coaching teachers, coaching parents, and **I realizing** my own parenting. I realized **my** best **attention** are getting in the way. **We live in a co-parencing**, and we wrong that our child won't be good enough, won't be good enough in the soccer team, won't be ready for the **kinder garden**, won't be **smart as a** classmates. And we wrong **that our** child doesn't **major up**, it will be our fault. Our **heaper fouse** on our children, on our students' success is **back firing**.

**It's those** interaction when a child **says** something, and parents **or teacher says** something back, those interactions help the child to **persist**, to stick with their plan, to keep rebuilding the block tower each time **it falls**. 

正是这些互动，当孩子说了些什么，父母或老师回应了些什么，这些互动帮助孩子坚持下去，坚持他们的计划，在每次积木塔倒塌时继续重建。

So it's the play **paired** with the adults' interactions, it's like super food for the brain. 

所以这是与成人互动配对的游戏，就像是大脑的超级食物。

The research community **in supportive** play is so resounding, I would **expect to see children** in nearly **every** household, every preschool **and kindergarten classroom** playing for most **of their waking hours.** 

支持性游戏的研究社区如此响亮，我希望看到几乎每个家庭、每个学前班和幼儿园教室里的孩子们在大部门醒着的时间里都在玩耍。

But **that's** far away from reality, we don't see **widespread** uptake **of play** among parents and teachers, and sometimes we even see **resistance**. 

但是事与愿违，我们没有看到家长或老师普遍接受游戏，有时我们甚至看到了阻力。

So what's going on? What's driving us as parents and teachers to ignore the overwhelming research when **it** comes to play? 

发生什么了？是什么驱使我们作为父母或老师在玩游戏时忽视压倒性的研究？

After years of teaching preschool, coaching teachers, coaching parents, and **analyzing** my own parenting. I realized **our** best **intentions** are getting in the way. 

经过多年的学前班教学、辅导老师、辅导家长和分析我自己的育儿方式，我意识到我们最好的意图正在受阻。

We live in a **comparison culture** and we wrong that our child won't be good enough, won't be good enough in the soccer team, won't be ready for the **kindergarten**, won't be **as smart as their** classmates. 

我们生活在比较文化中，我们担心我们的孩子不够好，不能参加足球队，不能上幼儿园，不能像同学一样聪明。

And we wrong **that if our** child doesn't **measure up**, it will be our fault. Our **hyperfocus** on our children and on our students' success is **backfiring**. 

我们担心如果我们的孩子不合格，那将是我们的错。我们过度的关注我们的孩子和我们的学生的成功适得其反。

And **it's exacerbated** by two forces I see **impacting **the large majority of parents and teachers. First, they need **for immediate gratification and quick results**. And second, **our own** discomfort with play, **either** because we don't have the time or energy, or because we **just** don't know how to play anymore.

我看到影响，绝大多数家长和老师的两种力量加剧了这种情况。首先，需要立即满足和快速见效，其次，我们自己对游戏感到不适。要么是因为我们没时间和精力，要么是我们不再知道如何玩了。
