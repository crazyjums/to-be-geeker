[video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyElHdaqkjo)

You know, I didn't set out to be a parenting expert.

我从没想过做一个育儿专家。

In fact I not very interested in parenting, per se.

事实上，我本身对育儿也没有什么兴趣。

It's just that there is a certain style of parenting these days. That's kind of messing up kids.

只是当今有一个中育儿方式，这种方式会把孩子搞得一团糟。

Impeding their chance to a develop into theirselves. 

阻止他们个人特质的培养。

These is a certain style of parenting these days that's getting in the way.

这种育儿方式，正在大行其道。

I guess I am saying is, We spend a  lot of time being very concerned about parents who aren't involved enough in the lives of their kids, in their life, and their education or their upbringing and rightly so.

我想说的是，我们花了很多时间和精力去担心父母没有足够参与到孩子的人生、教育以及养育过程中，这理所当然。

But at the end of the spectrum, these is a lot of harm going on there as well.

但如果走上另一个极端，也会有很多坏处。

Where parent feel a kid can't be successful, unless the parent to protecting and preventing at every turn and hovering over every happening, and micomangaing every moment, and steering the their kids towards some small subset of colleges and careers. 

比如，家长认为孩子自己不可能成功，除非父母可以随时保护和纠正，关注孩子的每件小事，掌控孩子的每个细节，引导他们进入名牌大学，找到工作。

> When we raise kids this way, and I will say 'WE', because lord knows , I have this tendencies myself. Our kids end up bling, a kind of checklist of childhood. And here is the checklist of childhood looks like, we keep them safe, and sound, and fat, and watered, and then, we wanna be sure their go to the right school, But not just as that, at the right classes of the right school, in the right grade of the right classes of right school, but not just the grade, but the scores. But noe just the grade and the scores, Don't join a club, start a club, because colleges wanna see that. And check the box of communitys service, I mean show the colleges you cares about others.

**fixed:**
When we raise kids this way, and I'll say we, beacase lord knows, in raising my to teenagers, I've had these two tendencies myself. 

当我们这样养育孩子时，我用的是“我们”，因为上帝知道，在养育我的2个十几岁的孩子的时候，我自己确实也有这2中倾向。

Our kids end up leading, a kind of checklisted childhood, And here is what the checklist childhood looks like:

让我们的孩子过一种清单式的童年，清单式的童年就是：

 we keep them safe, and sound, and fed, and watered, and then we want to be sure they go to the right schools, that they're in the right classes at the right schools, and that they get the right grades in the right classes in the right schools. 

我们确保他们安全、健康、吃好、喝好，然后期待他们进入好学校，并且时好学校的好班级，在好学校好班级还要取得好成绩。

But not just the grades, the scores, and not just the grades and scores, but the accolades and the awards, and the sports, the activities, the leadership. 

并且不只是好成绩，还要高分，不止是好成绩和拿高分，还要荣誉和奖项，要参加运动、活动、还要有领导力。

We tell our kids, don't just join a club, start a club, beacase colleges want to see that. And check the box of community service. I mean, show the colleges you care about others.

我们告诉我们的孩子，不要仅仅是参加社团，还要参加社团，因为大学喜欢这样的学生，还要参加社区服务，我的意思是，要让大学看到你会关心他人。

> And all of this, it's hopeful of degrees of perfection. We ecpected our kids to be . So because so much require we think, well, then, of course, we parent we have to arrgue with every teacher in principle, in coach, and referwe. And acter like our kids can see airs, and personal handlers. And scrtary, and then with our kids we spent so much time, ... to be sure they are, not closing doors, not ruining their future, some hoped-for mission to a tiny hand for all of colleges, they deny almost every applicant.

**fixed:**

And all of this is done to some hoped-for degree of perfection, 

所有这些期望中的完美，

we expected our kids to perform at a level of perfection we were never asked to perform at ourselves, 

我们期待我们的孩子能做到完美而我们自己却从未达到过

and so because so much required, we think, well, of course, we parents have to argue with every teacher, and principal and coach and referee, and act like our kid's concierge(门房),  and personal handler, and secretary(顾问).

因为有这么多的要求，我们回想，我们做父母的得和每个老师沟通、校长、教练、推荐人沟通，搞我们像是孩子的管家、私人管家、秘书。

And then with our kids, our precious kids, we spend so much time to nudging, cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling, nagging as the case may be, 

然后对孩子，我们宝贵的孩子，我们要花心思来监督、哄骗、暗示、帮忙、唠叨、甚至讨价还价，

to be sure they are not screwing up, not closing doors, not ruining their future, 

确保他们不会在申请顶尖大学这件事情上搞砸，或者故步自封，或者毁了他们自己的未来，

some hoped-for admission to a tiny handful of colleges they deny almost every applicant.

一些顶尖大学在招生时，几乎是万里挑一。
