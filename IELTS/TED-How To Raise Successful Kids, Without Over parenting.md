## How to Raise Successful Kids-Without over parenting

[video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyElHdaqkjo)

You know, I didn't set out to be a parenting expert.

我从没想过做一个育儿专家。

In fact I not very interested in parenting, per se.

事实上，我本身对育儿也没有什么兴趣。

It's just that there is a certain style of parenting these days. That's kind of messing up kids.

只是当今有一个中育儿方式，这种方式会把孩子搞得一团糟。

Impeding their chance to a develop into theirselves. 

阻止他们个人特质的培养。

These is a certain style of parenting these days that's getting in the way.

这种育儿方式，正在大行其道。

I guess I am saying is, We spend a  lot of time being very concerned about parents who aren't involved enough in the lives of their kids, in their life, and their education or their upbringing and rightly so.

我想说的是，我们花了很多时间和精力去担心父母没有足够参与到孩子的人生、教育以及养育过程中，这理所当然。

But at the end of the spectrum, these is a lot of harm going on there as well.

但如果走上另一个极端，也会有很多坏处。

Where parent feel a kid can't be successful, unless the parent to protecting and preventing at every turn and hovering over every happening, and micomangaing every moment, and steering the their kids towards some small subset of colleges and careers. 

比如，家长认为孩子自己不可能成功，除非父母可以随时保护和纠正，关注孩子的每件小事，掌控孩子的每个细节，引导他们进入名牌大学，找到工作。

> When we raise kids this way, and I will say 'WE', because lord knows , I have this tendencies myself. Our kids end up bling, a kind of checklist of childhood. And here is the checklist of childhood looks like, we keep them safe, and sound, and fat, and watered, and then, we wanna be sure their go to the right school, But not just as that, at the right classes of the right school, in the right grade of the right classes of right school, but not just the grade, but the scores. But noe just the grade and the scores, Don't join a club, start a club, because colleges wanna see that. And check the box of communitys service, I mean show the colleges you cares about others.

**fixed:**
When we raise kids this way, and I'll say we, beacase lord knows, in raising my to teenagers, I've had these two tendencies myself. 

当我们这样养育孩子时，我用的是“我们”，因为上帝知道，在养育我的2个十几岁的孩子的时候，我自己确实也有这2中倾向。

Our kids end up leading, a kind of checklisted childhood, And here is what the checklist childhood looks like:

让我们的孩子过一种清单式的童年，清单式的童年就是：

 we keep them safe, and sound, and fed, and watered, and then we want to be sure they go to the right schools, that they're in the right classes at the right schools, and that they get the right grades in the right classes in the right schools. 

我们确保他们安全、健康、吃好、喝好，然后期待他们进入好学校，并且时好学校的好班级，在好学校好班级还要取得好成绩。

But not just the grades, the scores, and not just the grades and scores, but the accolades and the awards, and the sports, the activities, the leadership. 

并且不只是好成绩，还要高分，不止是好成绩和拿高分，还要荣誉和奖项，要参加运动、活动、还要有领导力。

We tell our kids, don't just join a club, start a club, beacase colleges want to see that. And check the box of community service. I mean, show the colleges you care about others.

我们告诉我们的孩子，不要仅仅是参加社团，还要参加社团，因为大学喜欢这样的学生，还要参加社区服务，我的意思是，要让大学看到你会关心他人。

> And all of this, it's hopeful of degrees of perfection. We ecpected our kids to be . So because so much require we think, well, then, of course, we parent we have to arrgue with every teacher in principle, in coach, and referwe. And acter like our kids can see airs, and personal handlers. And scrtary, and then with our kids we spent so much time, ... to be sure they are, not closing doors, not ruining their future, some hoped-for mission to a tiny hand for all of colleges, they deny almost every applicant.

**fixed:**

And all of this is done to some hoped-for degree of perfection, 

所有这些期望中的完美，

we expected our kids to perform at a level of perfection we were never asked to perform at ourselves, 

我们期待我们的孩子能做到完美而我们自己却从未达到过

and so because so much required, we think, well, of course, we parents have to argue with every teacher, and principal and coach and referee, and act like our kid's concierge(门房),  and personal handler, and secretary(顾问).

因为有这么多的要求，我们回想，我们做父母的得和每个老师沟通、校长、教练、推荐人沟通，搞我们像是孩子的管家、私人管家、秘书。

And then with our kids, our precious kids, we spend so much time to nudging, cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling, nagging as the case may be, 

然后对孩子，我们宝贵的孩子，我们要花心思来监督、哄骗、暗示、帮忙、唠叨、甚至讨价还价，

to be sure they are not screwing up, not closing doors, not ruining their future, 

确保他们不会在申请顶尖大学这件事情上搞砸，或者故步自封，或者毁了他们自己的未来，

some hoped-for admission to a tiny handful of colleges they deny almost every applicant.

一些顶尖大学在招生时，几乎是万里挑一。

Well, we asked about all too offen** first is their homework and their grades, **and they say our faces,** that our **proofe**, that our love, that **they** very worth comes from eights, and then we work along side them, **and offer clocking prize, like a trainer at the west dock show.** **Hoping them** to just jump a little higher, and **sore** a little farther, day after day after day. When they get to **the** high school,  they don't say, **what mind I show be interested in study during** at activities, **they go to ...,** they say, what do I need to do to get into the "right college**s**". And then, when the grades start to **rolling** at high school, they are getting some busy, or got some bees at seats, **they friendly te**xt their friends, **does any one has got into the colleges with this grades.** And our kids, we gadless ..., they are briefless.they are brow, they are a little broned out, they are a little old before their time wishing they grow-up with in their lives has sad, what you have done is enough is in your checklisted childhood is enough. And they are wiier now, wander someone of them are wandering  will this life ever tend out to have to worth it.

**fixed:**

And here's what it feels like to be a kid in this checklisted childhood. First of all, there is no time for free play,  there is no rooms in the afternoons, because everything has to be enriching, we think. It's as if every piece of homework, every quiz, every activity is a make-or-break moment for this future we have in mind for them, and we absolve them of helping out around the house, and we even absolve them of getting enough sleep, as long as they are checking off the items on their checklist. **And in the** checklisted childhood, we say just want them to be happy, but when they come home from school, what we ask about all too often first is their homework and their grades. And they see in our faces, that our approval, that our love, that their very worth, comes from A's. And then we work along side them, and offer clucking praise like a trainer at the Westminster Dog Show. Coaxing them to just jump a little higher, and **soar** a little farther, day after day after day. When they get to high school, they don't day, "Well, what might I be interested in studying or doing as an activity?". They go to counselors and they say, "What do I need to do to get into the right college". And then when the grades start to roll in in high school, and they are getting some B's or God forbid some C's, they frantically text their friends and says, "Has anyone ever gotten into the right college with these grades". And our kids, regardless of where they end up at the end of high school. They are breathless. They are brittle. They are a little burned out. They are a little old before their time, wishing the grown-ups in their lives has said, "What you have done is enough, this effort you've put forth in childhood is enough.". And they are withering now under high rates of anxiety and depression and some of them are wondering, Will this life ever turn out to have to be worth it?

> Well, we parents, we parents are pretty sure it's all worth it. We seems to behave litery future, if they don't get into **these** one of these tiny set of colleges or careers we have in mind for them. Or maybe, maybe we are just afraid they won't have a future we **be rag** about to our friends **of sticks on the** backs of our cars. Bus if you look what we have done, if you have the **collurage** to really look at it, you'll see that not only do our kids think **they are worth in their scores.** But when we live in right up inside their pressure developing minds all the time, **like a very on acc of the movie, Be joing muclvch**. **We send our children's message t**hey kid. I don't think you can actually arrch this without me. And so with our over help, our over pretection, over direction of hand holding, we deprive our kids of the chance to build self-efficacy, which is really fundamental tenet of the human psyche, far more important than that self-efficacy they **get everytime we have** . **Self-efficacy is built when one leads to outcomes.**

Well, we parents, we parents are pretty sure it's all worth it. We seem to behave it's like we literally think they will have no future, if they don't get into one of these tiny set of colleges or careers we have in mind for them. Or maybe, maybe we are just afraid they won't have a future we brag about to our friends **and with stickers on the** backs of our cars. Yeah. Bus if you look what we have done, if you have the **courage** to really look at it, you'll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes from grades and scores, But when we live in right up inside their precious developing minds all the time, like our very own version of the movie "Being John Malkovich, ", we send our children the message: "Hey, kid, I don't think you can actually achieve any of this without me.". And so with our overhelp, our overprotection and overdirection and hand-holding, we deprive our kids of the chance to build self-efficacy, which is really fundamental tenet of the human psyche, far more important than that self-efficacy they **get every time we applaud**. Self-efficacy is built when one sees that one's own actions leads to outcomes,
