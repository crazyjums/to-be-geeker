## How to Raise Successful Kids-Without over parenting

[video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyElHdaqkjo)

You know, I didn't set out to be a parenting expert.

我从没想过做一个育儿专家。

In fact I not very interested in parenting, per se.

事实上，我本身对育儿也没有什么兴趣。

It's just that there is a certain style of parenting these days. That's kind of messing up kids.

只是当今有一个中育儿方式，这种方式会把孩子搞得一团糟。

Impeding their chance to a develop into theirselves. 

阻止他们个人特质的培养。

These is a certain style of parenting these days that's getting in the way.

这种育儿方式，正在大行其道。

I guess I am saying is, We spend a  lot of time being very concerned about parents who aren't involved enough in the lives of their kids, in their life, and their education or their upbringing and rightly so.

我想说的是，我们花了很多时间和精力去担心父母没有足够参与到孩子的人生、教育以及养育过程中，这理所当然。

But at the end of the spectrum, these is a lot of harm going on there as well.

但如果走上另一个极端，也会有很多坏处。

Where parent feel a kid can't be successful, unless the parent to protecting and preventing at every turn and hovering over every happening, and micomangaing every moment, and steering the their kids towards some small subset of colleges and careers. 

比如，家长认为孩子自己不可能成功，除非父母可以随时保护和纠正，关注孩子的每件小事，掌控孩子的每个细节，引导他们进入名牌大学，找到工作。

> When we raise kids this way, and I will say 'WE', because lord knows , I have this tendencies myself. Our kids end up bling, a kind of checklist of childhood. And here is the checklist of childhood looks like, we keep them safe, and sound, and fat, and watered, and then, we wanna be sure their go to the right school, But not just as that, at the right classes of the right school, in the right grade of the right classes of right school, but not just the grade, but the scores. But noe just the grade and the scores, Don't join a club, start a club, because colleges wanna see that. And check the box of communitys service, I mean show the colleges you cares about others.

**fixed:**
When we raise kids this way, and I'll say we, because lord knows, in raising my to teenagers, I've had these two tendencies myself. 

当我们这样养育孩子时，我用的是“我们”，因为上帝知道，在养育我的2个十几岁的孩子的时候，我自己确实也有这2中倾向。

Our kids end up leading, a kind of checklisted childhood, And here is what the checklist childhood looks like:

让我们的孩子过一种清单式的童年，清单式的童年就是：

 we keep them safe, and sound, and fed, and watered, and then we want to be sure they go to the right schools, that they're in the right classes at the right schools, and that they get the right grades in the right classes in the right schools. 

我们确保他们安全、健康、吃好、喝好，然后期待他们进入好学校，并且时好学校的好班级，在好学校好班级还要取得好成绩。

But not just the grades, the scores, and not just the grades and scores, but the accolades and the awards, and the sports, the activities, the leadership. 

并且不只是好成绩，还要高分，不止是好成绩和拿高分，还要荣誉和奖项，要参加运动、活动、还要有领导力。

We tell our kids, don't just join a club, start a club, because colleges want to see that. And check the box of community service. I mean, show the colleges you care about others.

我们告诉我们的孩子，不要仅仅是参加社团，还要参加社团，因为大学喜欢这样的学生，还要参加社区服务，我的意思是，要让大学看到你会关心他人。

> And all of this, it's hopeful of degrees of perfection. We ecpected our kids to be . So because so much require we think, well, then, of course, we parent we have to arrgue with every teacher in principle, in coach, and referwe. And acter like our kids can see airs, and personal handlers. And scrtary, and then with our kids we spent so much time, ... to be sure they are, not closing doors, not ruining their future, some hoped-for mission to a tiny hand for all of colleges, they deny almost every applicant.

**fixed:**

And all of this is done to some hoped-for degree of perfection, 

所有这些期望中的完美，

we expected our kids to perform at a level of perfection we were never asked to perform at ourselves, 

我们期待我们的孩子能做到完美而我们自己却从未达到过

and so because so much required, we think, well, of course, we parents have to argue with every teacher, and principal and coach and referee, and act like our kid's concierge(门房),  and personal handler, and secretary(顾问).

因为有这么多的要求，我们回想，我们做父母的得和每个老师沟通、校长、教练、推荐人沟通，搞我们像是孩子的管家、私人管家、秘书。

And then with our kids, our precious kids, we spend so much time to nudging, cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling, nagging as the case may be, 

然后对孩子，我们宝贵的孩子，我们要花心思来监督、哄骗、暗示、帮忙、唠叨、甚至讨价还价，

to be sure they are not screwing up, not closing doors, not ruining their future, 

确保他们不会在申请顶尖大学这件事情上搞砸，或者故步自封，或者毁了他们自己的未来，

some hoped-for admission to a tiny handful of colleges they deny almost every applicant.

一些顶尖大学在招生时，几乎是万里挑一。

Well, we asked about all too offen** first is their homework and their grades, **and they say our faces,** that our **proofe**, that our love, that **they** very worth comes from eights, and then we work along side them, **and offer clocking prize, like a trainer at the west dock show.** **Hoping them** to just jump a little higher, and **sore** a little farther, day after day after day. When they get to **the** high school,  they don't say, **what mind I show be interested in study during** at activities, **they go to ...,** they say, what do I need to do to get into the "right college**s**". And then, when the grades start to **rolling** at high school, they are getting some busy, or got some bees at seats, **they friendly te**xt their friends, **does any one has got into the colleges with this grades.** And our kids, we gadless ..., they are briefless.they are brow, they are a little broned out, they are a little old before their time wishing they grow-up with in their lives has sad, what you have done is enough is in your checklisted childhood is enough. And they are wiier now, wander someone of them are wandering  will this life ever tend out to have to worth it.

**fixed:**

And here's what it feels like to be a kid in this checklisted childhood.

那么在清单式童年中长大的孩子是怎样的呢

First of all, there is no time for free play,  there is no rooms in the afternoons, because everything has to be enriching, we think. 

首先，他们没有自由玩耍的时间，他们下午都没有空闲，因为我们觉得任务时间都要充实起来

It's as if every piece of homework, every quiz, every activity is a make-or-break moment for this future we have in mind for them, and we absolve them of helping out around the house, and we even absolve them of getting enough sleep, as long as they are checking off the items on their checklist. 

就好像每一项作业、每个测验、每个活动都对于我们为他们规划好的未来成败攸关。我们不让他们做家务，甚至不让他们有充足的睡眠，只需要他们把清单上的事情做好就行

**And in the** checklisted childhood, we say just want them to be happy, but when they come home from school, what we ask about all too often first is their homework and their grades. 

在清单式童年中，我们口头上希望他们开心，但是当他们从学校放学回来时，我们通常第一时间询问他们的是却是作业和成绩。

And they see in our faces, that our approval, that our love, that their very worth, comes from A's. 

他们从我们脸上看到的，我们的认可，我们的爱，看到他们的价值，却是来自成绩单上的A。

And then we work along side them, and offer clucking praise like a trainer at the Westminster Dog Show. 

和他们走在一起的时候，我们就像威斯敏斯特宠物展上的训狗员一样表扬他们，

Coaxing them to just jump a little higher, and **soar** a little farther, day after day after day. 

哄他们跳的再高一点，再远一点，日服一日。

When they get to high school, they don't day, "Well, what might I be interested in studying or doing as an activity?". 

等他们上了高中，他们不会问，”我该对哪些课程、哪些活动感兴趣呢？“

They go to counselors and they say, "What do I need to do to get into the right college". 

他们只会去问辅导员，”我要怎么做才能进入好的大学？“

And then when the grades start to roll in in high school, and they are getting some B's or God forbid some C's, they frantically text their friends and says, "Has anyone ever gotten into the right college with these grades". 

然后，当他们拿到成绩单，如果拿了几个B，甚至可怕的C，他们会狂躁的给朋友发短信，”有谁考这个分数进了好大学吗“

And our kids, regardless of where they end up at the end of high school. They are breathless.

我们的孩子，无论高中毕业时结果怎样，都被压得喘不过气

They are brittle. They are a little burned out. They are a little old before their time, wishing the grown-ups in their lives has said, "What you have done is enough, this effort you've put forth in childhood is enough.". 

心理脆弱，精疲力竭，他们比实际年龄更加老成，盼望这大人告诉他们，”你已经做的够多了，小时候这么努力已经足够了。“

And they are withering now under high rates of anxiety and depression and some of them are wondering, Will this life ever turn out to have to be worth it?

他们现在却在高分的焦虑和沮丧中慢慢枯萎，有的孩子会想，这样的人生最后究竟有没有意义？

> Well, we parents, we parents are pretty sure it's all worth it. We seems to behave litery future, if they don't get into **these** one of these tiny set of colleges or careers we have in mind for them. Or maybe, maybe we are just afraid they won't have a future we **be rag** about to our friends **of sticks on the** backs of our cars. Bus if you look what we have done, if you have the **collurage** to really look at it, you'll see that not only do our kids think **they are worth in their scores.** But when we live in right up inside their pressure developing minds all the time, **like a very on acc of the movie, Be joing muclvch**. **We send our children's message t**hey kid. I don't think you can actually arrch this without me. And so with our over help, our over pretection, over direction of hand holding, we deprive our kids of the chance to build self-efficacy, which is really fundamental tenet of the human psyche, far more important than that self-efficacy they **get everytime we have** . **Self-efficacy is built when one leads to outcomes**, not one's **parent's** action on one's **behave**, but when one's own actions lead to **outcome**, so simply put, if our children are to develop self-efficacy, and they must **than** they often to do a **hole** lot more of **their** thinking, planning, deciding, doing, hoping, **hoping**, **trace** and error, dreaming and experiencing **and life for themselves**. Now, **and I say** every kid is hard-working and **modivated**, and doesn't need a parent **involved** **entered their life**, **we just** **need** back-off and **let they go**. **Hell know**, that's not what I am saying, What **I saying** is, when we treat**, raising scores,**  and **aclate the words**, **that's** the purpose of childhood, **all in furthering**, some hoped-for admission to a tiny number of colleges, or a entrance to a small number of careers, **that's** too narrow of **defeattion** **with** success for our kids. And even though my helping them **arrch** **some short terms wins** by overhelping, like they get a better grade if we help **with** do their homework. they might end up with a longer childhood **resm** when we help, **what I'm saying is, is all that long-term cost** to the sense of selves, what I'm saying is, we **should less concern** **about** with **us** **specific college** they might be about to apply to or might get into. And far more concerned, that they have the habits, the **mind seed**, the **skill seed**, the **willness** to be successful whereever they go, what I'm saying is, our kids need us  to be a little **upsets** with **grade** and scores and **a whole more interest** in childhood in **privding** a fundation for **the** success. **Build tones seems** like love and choice, did I just say choice, did I just say choice, I really did. But really, here is the why. 

**fixed:**

Well, we parents, we parents are pretty sure it's all worth it. 

我们做父母的，当然认为这都有意义

We seem to behave it's like we literally think they will have no future, if they don't get into one of these tiny set of colleges or careers we have in mind for them. 

我们所表现出来的，就像如果他们进不去我们期望的这几所好大学，或者找不到好工作，他们就没有未来。

Or maybe, maybe we are just afraid they won't have a future we brag about to our friends **and with stickers on the** backs of our cars. 

或者，只是我们认为，我们可以再朋友面前炫耀，或者只是贴在车屁股上的未来。

Yeah. Bus if you look what we have done, if you have the **courage** to really look at it, you'll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes from grades and scores,

就是这样，但如果你看看这件事的后果，如果你有勇气看的话，你会发现这不只是孩子认为，他们的价值来自于成绩和分数，

But when we live in right up inside their precious developing minds all the time, like our very own version of the movie "Being John Malkovich, ", 

更是在他们正在成长的意识里，就像我们自己的电影《傀儡人生》一样，

we send our children the message: "Hey, kid, I don't think you can actually achieve any of this without me.". 

我们给孩子传递了一个信号：”嘿，孩子，没有我你什么都干不成。“

And so with our overhelp, our overprotection and overdirection and hand-holding, we deprive our kids of the chance to build self-efficacy, 

随着我们的过度帮助，过度保护，过度指导，过度关怀，我们剥夺了孩子建立自我能效的机会，

which is really fundamental tenet of the human psyche, far more important than that self-efficacy they **get every time we applaud**. 

自我能效时人类心智的重要准则，远比通过父母赞美建立起的自尊更重要

Self-efficacy is built when one sees that one's own actions leads to outcomes. not one's parents' action on one's **behalf**,  but when one's own actions lead to **outcomes**. 

自我能效是当一个人看到自己的行动能产生成果而建立起来的，不是父母代表他们做出的行动，是他们自己的行动能产生结果。

So simply put, if our children are to develop self-efficacy, and they must, **then** they often to do a **whole** lot more of **the** thinking, planning, deciding, doing, hoping, **coping**, **trial** and error, dreaming and experiencing **of life for themselves**. 

简而言之，如果我们的孩子要建立自我能效，他们也必须建立自我能效，就需要更多的为他们自己的人生做更多思考、规划、决定、行动、期望、应对、实验、犯错、梦想以及体验。

Now, am I saying every kid is hard-working and **motivated**, and doesn't need a parent **involvement** **interest in  their lives,** **we should** **just** back off and **let go?** 

我现在是不是在说，每个孩子都很努力，都很积极，都不需要对他们的人生有干涉和关心，我们应该退后，任其发展呢？

Hell no. That's not what I am saying.

当然不是，这不是我想说的

What I'm saying is, when we treat grades and scores and accolades and awards as the purpose of childhood, **all in furtherance** of some hoped-for admission to a tiny number of colleges, or a entrance to a small number of careers, that **that's** too narrow of **definition** **of** success for our kids. 

我想说的是，当我们把成绩、分数、荣誉和奖励看作他们童年的奋斗目标，当我们代孩子去追求进入理想中的大学，找到理想的工作，这种对于成功的定义太过于狭隘，

And even though my helping them **achieve** **some short-term wins** by overhelping like they get a better grade if we help **them** do their homework, they might end up with a longer childhood **resume** when we help, 

即使我们可以通过这种过度帮助来让他们获得一些短期的成功--比如帮他们做作业而拿到好的成绩，在我们的帮助下，他们可能会有一个更好的童年简历，

what I'm saying is that all of this comes at a  long-term cost to their sense of self. 

我要说的是，这些会让他们在自我认知上付出长期的代价

what I'm saying is, we **should be less concerned with the specific set of colleges** they might be about to apply to or might get into and far more concerned that they have the habits, the **mind set, the skill set**,  the **wellness** to be successful whereever they go.

我要说的是，我们应该更好关注具体哪些名牌大学他们应该申请或进入，而更多关注他们的习惯、心态、技能、身心健康，有了这些，他们才能在哪都成功

What I'm saying is, our kids need us  to be a little **obsessed** with **grades** and scores and a whole lot more interested in childhood in **providing** a foundation for **their** success built on things like love and chores. 

我要说的是，孩子需要我们少一点痴迷于成绩和分数，而将重点放在打造一个能帮助他们为成功奠基的童年上，比如，爱，做家务

Did I just say chores? Did I just say chores, I really did. But really, here's why.

我刚才说的是做家务吗？是的，我的确是这么说的，但是这是真的，原因如下。

> The longest **of ... to know** study of **human** of **every** conducted, **it's** called **harvard-grand study**. **It's** found professional success in life which is what we want for our kids, the professional success in life **comes** having done chores as a kid, and earlier you **study the better**. **That's roll up the sleep, picking mindset**, **there are some present work**, **minds will be me**, **and mindset contribute of ,** **and that is what you get in the head**, **and** we all know this, you all know this. We all know this, and yet, **checklisted childhood**, we absolve our kids of **doing the chores** around the house, **and then they end up the youngest the workplace** still waiting for a checklist, but it doesn't exist. **But** more importantly, **lagging the impose, the instack** **roll up the sleep, and picking** **to** look around and wonder, "How can I be useful to my colleagues, How can I **antispit** **the feel start the head what my boss waht I need**? ". A second very **founding** from **harvard-grand study**, said **the** happness in life comes from love not love **fork**, love of **human**, **our ...**, our partner, our friends, our family, so childhood needs to teach our kids how to love **they** can't love others, **they** don't first love themselves, and they won't love themselves, if we can't offer them unconditional love. Right.

fixed:

The longest **longitudinal** study of **humans** of **ever** conducted, is called **Harvard Grand Study**. 

史上历时最长的人类研究，被称作哈佛格兰特研究。

**It** found professional success in life, which is what we want for our kids, the professional success in life **comes from** having done chores as a kid, 

这项研究发现，专业上的成功，也就是我们期望孩子达到的，取决于小时候做的杂活，

and earlier **you started, the better,** that a roll-up-your-sleeves-and-pitch-in mindset, 

越早开始越好，这种挽起袖子开干的心态，

a mindset that says, there's some unpleasant work, someone 's got to do it, it mights as well be me, a mindset that says, I will contribute my effort to the betterment of the whole, that that's what gets you ahead in the workplace. 

这种心态代表着：可能有些不想做的工作，总要有人去完成它，这个人可能就是我；这种心态代表着：我会尽力去改善整件事情，这就是让你在工作中获得先机的东西。

**Now** we all know this. You all know this. 

我们都懂得这个道理。你们都懂。

We all know this, and yet, **in the checklisted childhood**, we absolve our kids of **doing the work of chores** around the house, 

我们都已经清楚，在清单式同年中，我们不让孩子做家里的杂活，

**and then they end up as young adults in the workplace** still waiting for a checklist, but it doesn't exist, 

当他们长大进入职场，还在等待一个清单，但是这个清单并不存在，

**and** more importantly, **lacking the impulse, the instinct** to roll up their sleeves and pitch in **and** look around and wonder, "How can I be useful to my colleagues?", "How can I anticipate a few steps ahead to what my boss might need?". 

更重要的是，他们缺乏动力和意识，不能挽起袖子去开干，不能望向四周，并心想，我们怎样才能帮上同事的忙？我怎样才能提前一步预见到老板的要求？

A second very **finding** from **the Harvard Grant Study**, said that happiness in life comes from love, not love of work, love of **humans**: **our spouse**, our partner, our friends, our family. 

哈佛格兰特另一项重要发现，人生的幸福，不是对工作的爱，是对人类的爱，我们的配偶，我们的伙伴，我们的朋友，我们的家庭。

So childhood needs to teach our kids how to love, **and they** can't love others, **if they** don't first love themselves, and they won't love themselves, if we can't offer them unconditional love. Right.

所以，我们要教孩子如何去爱，要爱别人，他们要首先学会爱自己，想要他们爱自己，我们就要给予他们无条件的爱。是的。

And when your **teenager** daughter says, "lunch, like mine did", and I wanna hear about the math test, not lunch, you have to still **take** interest in lunch, you got to say, what was great about in lunch today? They need to know they **better** to us as humans, not because of their GPA. All right, so you're thinking, **chores, love,** that's sounds all well and good,  but give me a break, the **college** want to say top scores, and grades, and accolades, and awards, and I'm **gonna** tell you **soda**, the very biggest brand name **school** **our** asking that of our young adults. But here is the good news, **contributes** **of the** college ranking **rack** would have **a belief**, you don't have to go one of the biggest brand name of schools to be happy and successful in life, happy **in** successful people, went to **a** **stage** school, went to a small "college no one has heard of", went to community college, went to a college over here, and **found** out, the evidence is in this room, is in our communities, **but** this is the truth. And if we **why is  a few more colleges maybe remove on our eggoes from the quiz**, we could accept and **enbrace** this **is** truth and then **relieaze**, it's hardly end up the world if our kids don't go **the** one of **the** biggest brand name schools, and more importantly, if their childhood has not **be** lived according to a **teranical** checklist, **that** when they get to college, **which everyone** it is, well **they** have gone there on their own **vlition**, **feel** by their own **dirare**, capable and ready to **arrive** there. I have to admit something to you, I have get to kids **as** I mentioned, **sor and aer**, they are teenagers, and once upon a time, I think I was treating my **sor and ary** like **a** little **bound side** trees, that I was **gonna** carefully **crown** and **shaped** to **them as a** prefect form of **human**, that might just be prefect enough to **warm** them admission to one of the **most tiny selected** colleges, but **I** come to realize after working with thousands of other people's kids, and raising two kids **in** my own, my kids **are** **boundside** trees, they are **wild flowers**, of **them** unknow **genius space**, and **this is** my job to provide **narrowing** **enviroment** to **strggle** them **though** chores **and** love them **until** they can love others and receive love, and the college, the major, the career, that's up to them. My job is not to make them become what I would have them become, but to support them in becoming their **grovy** **themselves**. Thank you.

fixed:

And so, instead of being **obsessed with grades and scores when they come home, when our precious offspring come home from school**, **or** we come home from work,

所以，放下对成绩和分数的痴迷，当我们亲爱的孩子放学回家，或者我们下班回家，

we need to close our technology, put away our **phones** and look at them in the eye and let them see the joy **that fills** our faces when we see **our** child **for** the first time **in a** few hours. 

我们需要把电子设备关掉，把手机放在一边，看着他们的眼睛，让他们看到我们脸上洋溢的喜悦就像第一次看到我们初生的孩子一样。

And then we have to say, "How was your day? What did you like about today?". 

然后我们应该说，今天过的怎么样？今天有什么高兴的事吗？

And when your **teenage** daughter says, "Lunch", like mine did, and I wanna hear about the math test, not lunch, you have to still **take an** interest in lunch. 

然后你的女儿会说，“午饭”，就像我的女儿一样，但我想听的是数学考试，不是午饭，但你还是得表现出对午饭的兴趣，

You got to say, what was great about in lunch today? 

你应该说，“今天的午饭哪里比较棒？”

They need to know they **matter** to us as humans, not because of their GPA. 

他们需要知道，他们本身对我们很重要，而不是他们的学习成绩。

All right, so you're thinking, **chores and love,** that's sounds all well and good, but give me a break. 

好，你可能会想，家务和爱，这听起来很好，但是得了吧。

The **colleges** want to say top scores and grades, and accolades, and awards, and I'm **going** tell you, sort of. The very biggest brand-name **schools** **are** asking that of our young adults, but here is the good news. 

大学看的是好成绩、荣誉和奖项，我会告诉你，是有那么点。那些最有名的学校需要这些，但是有个好消息。

**Contrary to what the** college **rankings** **racket** would have **us a believe**,  you don't have to go one of the biggest brand name of schools to be happy and successful in life. Happy **and** successful people, went to **state** school, went to a small college no one has heard of, went to community college, went to a college over here and **flunked** out. 

与大学排行榜传达的信息相反，你不需要为了人生的幸福和成功，而一定要去那些最有名的学校。信服和成功的人们也会来自于公立学校，来自于没人听过的学院，来自于社区大学，来自于附近的学校甚至被退学。

The evidence is in this room, is in our communities, **that** this is the truth. 

证据就来自这个房间，来自我们的社区，这就是事实。

And if we **could widen our blinders and be willing to look at a few more colleges, maybe remove our own egos from the equation,** 

如果我们把眼光打开，愿意看一些别的大学，抛开我们的偏见，

we could accept and **embrace** this truth and then **realize**, it's hardly end up the world if our kids don't go **to** one of **those** biggest brand-name schools. 

我们会接受并拥抱这个事实，并且意识到我们的孩子考不上顶尖大学，并不是什么世界末日 

And more importantly, if their childhood has not **been** lived according to a **tyrnnical** checklist **then** when they get to college, **whichever one** it is, well **they'll** have gone there on their own **volition**, **fueled** by their own **desire**, capable and ready to **thrive** there. 

更重要的是，如果孩子不在严格的清单约束下长大，等他们进入大学，不管什么大学，都是他们自主决定的，是他们自身渴望的，想要在那里有一番作为

I have to admit something to you, I have get to kids I mentioned, **Sawyer and Avery**, they are teenagers. 

我得向你们坦白一些事，我刚才提到我的两个孩子，Sawyer and Avery，他们都十来岁。

And once upon a time, I think I was treating my **Sawyer and Avery** like little **bonsai** trees, that I was **going** carefully **clip and prune** and **shape into some** prefect form of **a human** that might just be prefect enough to **warrant** them admission to one of the **most highly selective** colleges. 

有一次，我觉得我对待我的Sawyer and Avery就像盆栽一样，我想要小心的把他们修修剪剪，塑造成完美的人，完美到可以把他们送进最受欢迎的大学。

But **I've** come to realize after working with thousands of other people's kids and raising two kids **of** my own, my kids **aren't** **bonsai** trees. 

但是，我在工作中接触了几千个别人家的孩子，我才意识到，他们不是盆栽，

They are **wildflowers**. Of **an** unknown **genus and space** and **it is** my job to provide **a nourishing** **environment** to **strengthen** them **through** chores **and to** love them **so** they can love others and receive love, and the college, the major, the career, that's up to them. 

他们是野花。未知品种的野花，我的工作是提供成长的环境，通过家务和爱让他们变得强大，爱他们，他们才会爱别人，接受爱。上大学、选专业、找工作，这由他们自己决定。

My job is not to make them become what I would have them become, but to support them in becoming their **glorious** **selves**. Thank you.

我的工作不是把他们变成我想要他们成为的样子，而是支持他们做辉煌的自己。谢谢。
